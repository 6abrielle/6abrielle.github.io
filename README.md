*This is the canonical "Hello, World" program made during the lecture as an example for the class. I've made a few minor tweaks to alter what the sprite says, how it moves and the background. This was easy enough because I was manipulating variables that we had already been introduced to. At this stage I don't understand what else I can do on Scratch.*

When Scratchy asks: "Ready to see what you're going to learn over the next 9 weeks?" you need to answer no because the programme is unfinished.

*Here I intended to make an interactive story of the course outline. I lacked the technical knowledge to finish it in the first week. I'd like to keep working on it.*

Press the space bar to bounce over the watermelons. See how many you can clear!

*I followed a tutorial more or less exactly for this one. I actually found this process really good for my learning. Although I wasn't really being creative in this process, it gave me some foundational knowledge to understand what can be done using Scratch, and inspired further ideas.*
